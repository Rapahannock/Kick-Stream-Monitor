## ⚠️ **Important: Replace ALL Files**

Your current GitHub repository has the **old v3.3 files**. You need to **completely replace** them with the new v4.0 files.

## 📂 **Files to Upload to GitHub Root**

Upload **ALL** these files from `/home/ubuntu/github-ready/` to your GitHub repository root:

### **✅ Required Files:**
1. `index.html` ← **Main application (REPLACE existing)**
2. `demo.html` ← **Demo version**
3. `main.css` ← **Main styles (NEW)**
4. `components.css` ← **Component styles (NEW)**
5. `main.js` ← **Main JavaScript (NEW)**
6. `filterManager.js` ← **Filtering system (NEW)**
7. `streamerManager.js` ← **API management (NEW)**
8. `historyManager.js` ← **Analytics system (NEW)**
9. `notificationManager.js` ← **Notifications (NEW)**

15. `.gitignore` ← **Git ignore (NEW)**

## 🔄 **Upload Steps:**

### **Method 1: GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/rapahannock/Kick-Stream-Monitor`
2. **Delete the old `index.html`** (click on it → Delete)
3. Click **"Add file" → "Upload files"**
4. **Drag all 15 files** from the list above
5. Commit with message: **"Update to v4.0 - Modern design with advanced features"**

### **Method 2: Git Command Line**
```bash
# Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/rapahannock/Kick-Stream-Monitor.git
cd Kick-Stream-Monitor

# Remove old files
rm index.html

# Copy new files (adjust path as needed)
cp /path/to/github-ready/* .

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Update to v4.0 - Modern design with advanced features"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ **After Upload:**

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update
2. **Visit**: `https://rapahannock.github.io/Kick-Stream-Monitor/`
3. **Check**: Modern dark theme should load properly
4. **Test**: `https://rapahannock.github.io/Kick-Stream-Monitor/demo.html`

## 🐛 **Current Issue:**

The error `https://rapahannock.github.io/src/styles/main.css` means:
- Your current repository still has **old v3.3 files**
- The new v4.0 files haven't been uploaded yet
- CSS files are missing from the root directory

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

After uploading, your site should look like the **modern dark theme** with:
- Professional styling and animations
- Responsive design
- Advanced filtering interface
- Modern color scheme and typography

**The files in `/home/ubuntu/github-ready/` are ready to upload - they have the correct relative paths and will work perfectly on GitHub Pages!**
